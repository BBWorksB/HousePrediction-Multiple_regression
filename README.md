# House Price Prediction Project
![title](<img.jpg>)

## 1. Project Overview
- The dataset: The dataset consists of historical data on house prices and their corresponding features. It provides a rich source of information to analyze and build a predictive model.

- Data preprocessing: The dataset undergoes data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, and addressing any outliers or data inconsistencies.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable (house prices). Visualizations and statistical analyses are utilized to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.

- Feature engineering: Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model. Techniques such as categorical encoding may be applied.

- Model development: The regression model is developed using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. Multiple regression techniques are employed to analyze the relationships between the independent variables and the target variable. The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics and statistical tests.

- Model evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, F-statistic, and significance of individual coefficients. Residual analysis, including visualizations and diagnostic tests, is conducted to check for model assumptions and evaluate its goodness of fit.

- Model refinement: Based on the evaluation results, the model is refined by removing non-significant variables, addressing any issues related to model assumptions, and exploring additional techniques to improve its performance.

## 2. Business understanding

### a) Intoduction
In this project, the aim is to analyze house sales in a northwestern county using multiple linear regression modeling. By leveraging historical data on house sales and associated factors, we seek to gain insights into the dynamics of the local real estate market.This is to help:
* Homeowners and Home Buyers: Homeowners looking to sell their property can leverage the model's predictions to estimate the potential selling price and make informed decisions about pricing and negotiation. Home buyers can use the predictions to assess whether a listed house is reasonably priced, helping them in their decision-making process.


### b) Problem of the statement
The objective is to address the challenges faced by various homeowners and home buyers in the housing market. Specifically, we aim to identify the key factors influencing house sale prices and develop a predictive model to accurately estimate the selling price of houses based on these factors.

### c) Main Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide actionable insights and decision-making support to homeowners and home buyers in the housing market by leveraging multiple linear regression modeling. By understanding the relationships between house characteristics (such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, amenities) and sale prices, we aim to enhance pricing strategies, optimize property values, and facilitate informed negotiations.

### d) Specific Objectives
1. Develop a robust multiple linear regression model that accurately predicts house sale prices based on relevant features.
2. Identify the most significant factors that influence house prices in the northwestern county, prioritizing features that have the greatest impact.
3. Provide homeowners and home buyers with a comprehensive understanding of the local housing market dynamics, enabling them to make data-driven decisions regarding house pricing.

## 3. Modeling
In the modeling section of this project, we aimed to develop a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features and attributes. The model was built using the OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression technique, a widely used method for linear regression analysis.

To build an effective predictive model, we carefully selected relevant features that could influence house prices. These features included property characteristics such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, condition, grade, waterfront status, and age. Additionally, we considered variables related to the view category of the property.

## 4. Regression Results
The developed model demonstrated a high R-squared value of 0.883, indicating that approximately 88.3% of the variation in house prices could be explained by the selected features. The F-statistic was significant, suggesting that the overall model was statistically significant.


## 5. Conclusion
- The regression model presented in this analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing house prices. It demonstrates a strong ability to predict prices based on relevant variables such as waterfront, condition, grade, view categories, bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage of living area, and age. The model's performance and significance make it a valuable tool for understanding the housing market.
-  From the model Several predictor variables emerged as significant contributors to house prices. Notably, the presence of a waterfront, condition, grade, and different view categories (average, excellent, none) showed strong associations with house prices. 
- Additionally, factors such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage of living area, and the age of the house played significant roles in determining the price. 
- On the other hand, variables such as square footage of the lot and the number of floors did not demonstrate a significant impact.

## 6. Recommendation
-  The model should be further refined and validated to ensure the model's reliability and applicability in real-world scenarios, moreover, further analysis can enhance its robustness and interpretability.
- The house prices either to sell or purchase should be determined by the location thats the accessibility of the waterfront, presence of a good view and a better or a higer grading.
